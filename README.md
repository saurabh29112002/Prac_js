In the File of 4_comparison you will se that null==0 is not true
and null > 0 is also not true but when we see null >= 0 then it is true because,
equality check == and comparison > <= work differently.
Comparison convert null to a number,  treating it as 0
That's why null >= 0 is true and null > 0 is false.
